                    <p>The relationship between a husband and wife is one that is special and unique to them. Certainly everyone understands that every home is built from the inside out, that the relationship between the husband and wife is the core of their lives. If so, why are weddings such public events, where a huge crowd comes to watch the moment when the new <em>Chasan</em> and <em>Kallah</em> become linked to each other as husband and wife?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we must understand why the home is the core of all of Judaism. Our purpose in the world is to build ourselves up to be better people, better servants of <em>Hashem</em>. The Jewish Community is built as the system to ensure that these values are the focus of our lives. Every community has <em>Shuls</em>, <em>Batei Medrashim</em>, <em>Mikvahs</em>, <em>Chesed Organizations</em>, <em>Yeshivos</em>, and girls' schools that all have this same focus: to build Torah, Mitzvos, and Avodas Hashem.</p>
<p>But the building blocks of the community are the Jewish homes. It is specifically in the home where on a personal and individual level every man, woman, and child has the opportunity to develop themselves to reach each one's true potential. In every home, there are challenges and triumphs, hard times and happy times, each one an opportunity for growth to become the person you are meant to be. Every new couple that joins the families of <em>Klal Yisrael</em> is a new block that makes up the fabric of the Jewish Community. This is why at every wedding, the community must go to welcome the new couple into the families of the Jewish people. We must go out and join in the <em>Simcha</em> of the new couple, to show them: you are now a new home in <em>Klal Yisrael</em>, your home will help strengthen and build the future of the Jewish people!</p>
<p>We can see how there are two aspects to the Jewish home. On the outside, every home helps the greater community reach the lofty goals that the world was created for. When all the homes join together in pursuit of creating this ultimate good, we will be successful.</p>
<p>This is why the community comes out to welcome the new home into <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. They are accepting this new home as an equal partner in reaching their goal of building <em>Yiddishkeit</em>. This is why the Jewish home is the core of all of Judaism.</p>
<p>But the core itself has to be built strong internally. It has to be built with privacy and modesty. The couple need to really understand and internalize that both their own personal satisfaction in life and their contribution to the <em>Klal</em> is dependent on building the core of their lives, and that is their marriage.</p>
