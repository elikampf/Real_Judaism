                    <p>If you've been following along with our series on Jewish marriage, you might notice something that seems contradictory. I've written about commitment and hard work being essential for marriage success. But I've also said it takes a miracle for a man and woman to live together in peace and happiness.</p>

                    <p>So which is it? Hard work or a miracle?</p>

                    <p>The answer to this question is the key to everything in Jewish marriage. You need to understand it, believe it, internalize it, and live it. This will change your marriage and change your life.</p>

                    <h2>The Answer That Changes Everything</h2>

                    <p>The truth is there really is a third partner in your home—if you let Him in. This third partner brings peace, love, and happiness. He wants to come, but you have to want Him there too.</p>

                    <p>By bringing Hashem into your home as a full partner, you're tapping into powers way beyond our human capabilities. Hashem is the one who split the sea to bring every husband and wife together. You only stood under the chuppah with your spouse because Hashem put you there, together.</p>

                    <p>Now you need to bring Him into your home.</p>

                    <p>Hashem will bring the miracle you need, but you need to do the hard work to make Him feel welcome.</p>

                    <h2>The Foundation: Absolute Trust</h2>

                    <p>The first step is having true emunah and clarity that Hashem sent you your partner to help you reach your life's mission. Hashem doesn't make mistakes. Trust Him.</p>

                    <p>Once you truly know that Hashem sent you your soulmate—for this world and the next—you can fully trust Him and bring Him into your home.</p>

                    <p>But how do you actually do that?</p>

                    <h2>The Secret of Candlelight</h2>

                    <p>There's a deep mystical power that brings peace to your home through Shabbos candle lighting. Our sages teach that shalom bayis comes through that candlelight—not just because light prevents problems in darkness, but something much deeper.</p>

                    <p>Light represents seeing clearly. By "shining light" on an issue, you gain clarity to handle it calmly and thoughtfully. A person in darkness is confused and unsure. Someone with light has a clear vision of the path ahead.</p>

                    <p>The Friday night Shabbos lights bring in the Shabbos Queen—the Shechinah. Hashem Himself is coming into your home. When Hashem enters, He brings royalty and blessing—the source of all blessing.</p>

                    <p>Within that candlelight, a couple can see clearly how to bring peace into their home. The light illuminates the understanding that only by having Hashem in your home will there be true peace.</p>

                    <h2>Your Guiding Light</h2>

                    <p>Now let's connect these ideas practically. Your guiding light is understanding that Hashem brought you together to create a home that forms the core of the Jewish nation. This is the purpose of marriage.</p>

                    <p>Next, internalize that this is your purpose. Hashem sent you the perfect partner to accomplish this goal. Your spouse is your other half, specifically filling in the parts you're lacking, and vice versa. This complete unit is the foundation of your home.</p>

                    <p>When you stay focused on these goals, you'll realize that all your spouse's good points and challenging points are intrinsically linked to creating that complete unit. It's specifically because your spouse has these traits that you have the opportunity to bond into one unit.</p>

                    <h2>The Alternative Perspective</h2>

                    <p>Someone not guided by this light goes into marriage with selfish expectations: "How can I get the most out of my marriage?" When stuck in darkness, they see their spouse's traits as bothersome and annoying, causing rifts because clearly it's their fault that "I'm not getting what I want."</p>

                    <p>But when your approach is building a Jewish home, you know two things: you trust Hashem and will do everything to bring Him into your home, and your spouse—every detail about them—is the perfect match for building this home.</p>

                    <h2>The Power of Prayer: Your Strongest Tool</h2>

                    <p>Now that we've established the need to make Hashem the base of your home, here's how to do it. The first and strongest hishtadlus you can do is prayer.</p>

                    <p>Our sages teach that a person might be brilliant, strong, and talented, but will only see success if Hashem wills it. Together with all the hard work necessary for a happy home, you must ask Hashem to make it successful.</p>

                    <p>This point cannot be overstated. It's tragic when people try every possible solution except the most powerful one: prayer.</p>

                    <h2>Daily Partnership with Hashem</h2>

                    <p>Every single day, ask Hashem for His help to bring shalom bayis.</p>

                    <p>Tefilah is incredibly powerful—you must tap into it. Pray generally and specifically. Ask Hashem to bring peace and love into your home and heart. Make these prayers personal, asking Hashem to help you connect more deeply with your spouse.</p>

                    <p>Pray at any time. Have an important topic to discuss? Something sensitive? Ask Hashem to help you say it the right way so it leads to closeness, not the opposite.</p>

                    <p>Here are two major benefits: First, you get help from Hashem. Hashem wants you to have shalom bayis—you just need to ask. Second, by doing this, you're making Hashem a partner in your home.</p>

                    <h2>Making It Personal</h2>

                    <p>When it comes to shalom bayis, couples must realize so many things are beyond their control. Even with the best intentions, you can't predict what challenges you'll face.</p>

                    <p>This is why you need the third partner close to your heart. The automatic response to any difficulty should be turning to Him first. There are issues you won't have answers to, but He always does.</p>

                    <p>Tefillah is called Avodah She'balev—service of the heart. Pray for your specific circumstances:</p>

                    <p>"Hashem, help me express this topic to my spouse the right way so it brings us together."</p>

                    <p>"Please Hashem, put the right words in my mouth to connect to my spouse."</p>

                    <p>"Hashem, help me see the good in my spouse daily, and for him/her to see the good in me."</p>

                    <p>These words should be your daily companion. If they are, you'll see significant changes in your home, whether you've been married three months or thirty years.</p>

                    <h2>Where Hashem Wants to Dwell</h2>

                    <p>The sages teach a parable of a king marrying off his only daughter. Missing her, he asks his son-in-law to make a room so he can always be close to his daughter.</p>

                    <p>This represents the Mishkan. Hashem gave His daughter, the Torah, to the Jewish people, but can't be separated from it. The more Torah in your home, the more Hashem will be present.</p>

                    <p>Learning Torah at home—besides learning in the Beis Medrash—is fundamental to building your home and bringing shalom bayis. Say Divrei Torah at meals, transforming them into uplifting experiences, like eating from Hashem's table.</p>

                    <p>Study Halacha together. Areas like Hilchos Shabbos, Kashrus, Lashon Hara, and Taharas Hamishpacha offer opportunities for husband and wife to spend daily time strengthening their connection to Hashem and each other.</p>

                    <p>When Hashem sees you care, He'll want to join you.</p>

                    <h2>The Ways of Peace</h2>

                    <p>Remember the pasuk: "All the ways of Torah lead to peace." This is Hashem's goal: bring peace into the world and you bring Me into the world.</p>

                    <p>Your first step is bringing peace into your home, which brings the Shechinah into your home.</p>

                    <p>Our examples are the Avos and Imahos, especially Avraham and Sarah, who had the closest relationship in history. Together they reached complete shlaimus. They were one, clearly seen through the miraculous candle lit all week, blessing in the bread, and cloud hovering over their tent.</p>

                    <p>This happened because of their love and respect for each other, each sacrificing and being moser nefesh even when difficult. Where there's love and peace, Hashem says "I want to be with them."</p>

                    <p>Shalom bayis isn't just good advice—it's the path to the world's purpose. This is so important to Hashem that He's willing to erase His own name to bring peace between husband and wife.</p>

                    <p>Doesn't that sound worth the effort?</p>
