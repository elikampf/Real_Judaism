TITLE: The Core of Judaism
EXCERPT: Why do weddings require a community? Discover how every Jewish home becomes a building block of the entire Jewish nation and why your marriage matters to everyone.

The relationship between a husband and wife is one that is special and unique to them. Certainly everyone understands that every home is built from the inside out, that the relationship between the husband and wife is the core of their lives. If so, why are weddings such public events, where a huge crowd comes to watch the moment when the new *Chasan* and *Kallah* become linked to each other as husband and wife?

To answer this question, we must understand why the home is the core of all of Judaism. Our purpose in the world is to build ourselves up to be better people, better servants of *Hashem*. The Jewish Community is built as the system to ensure that these values are the focus of our lives. Every community has *Shuls*, *Batei Medrashim*, *Mikvahs*, *Chesed* Organizations, *Yeshivos*, and girls' schools that all have this same focus: to build *Torah*, *Mitzvos*, and *Avodas Hashem*.

But the building blocks of the community are the Jewish homes. It is specifically in the home where on a personal and individual level every man, woman, and child has the opportunity to develop themselves to reach each one's true potential. In every home, there are challenges and triumphs, hard times and happy times, each one an opportunity for growth to become the person you are meant to be. Every new couple that joins the families of *Klal Yisrael* is a new block that makes up the fabric of the Jewish Community. This is why at every wedding, the community must go to welcome the new couple into the families of the Jewish people. We must go out and join in the *Simcha* of the new couple, to show them: you are now a new home in *Klal Yisrael*, your home will help strengthen and build the future of the Jewish people!

We can see how there are two aspects to the Jewish home. On the outside, every home helps the greater community reach the lofty goals that the world was created for. When all the homes join together in pursuit of creating this ultimate good, we will be successful.

This is why the community comes out to welcome the new home into *Klal Yisrael*. They are accepting this new home as an equal partner in reaching their goal of building *Yiddishkeit*. This is why the Jewish home is the core of all of Judaism.

But the core itself has to be built strong internally. It has to be built with privacy and modesty. The couple need to really understand and internalize that both their own personal satisfaction in life and their contribution to the *Klal* is dependent on building the core of their lives, and that is their marriage.

Why is it that every couple comes to the Chuppah with the best intentions to build the most beautiful home, with great *Shalom Bayis*, but somehow there always seem to be tremendous difficulties just a few short weeks or months afterward?

Did you think it was just you?

Well, it isn't.

This happens to just about every single couple. The question is why, and what can we do to overcome it?

The truth is that men and women are so intrinsically different that it is really a miracle when they build a happy, harmonious home. The differences are far and wide. Besides for growing up in different homes, going to different schools, having different experiences, even just the biological and hormonal differences between men and women is enough to make the creation of one unified home very challenging. After the excitement of the engagement and wedding wears off, the couple settles into "regular" life and then all of these differences become much more clear. Disagreements can lead to fights, and slowly upsetting thoughts can sneak their way into each one's head.

"I thought we were so similar when we were dating and engaged! What happened?"

"Did I make a big mistake?"

"I didn't realize he/she was like that. I don't know if I can live like this."

It's very important to realize this process is very common and normal. It doesn't reflect on the sustainability of the marriage. Every couple goes through a transition from the excitement of the new relationship to settling down into real life. Most of the time, it isn't necessarily smooth.

Just hold on!

**We'll discuss what you can do about it next week.**
(It will work for couples married for longer too!)

Most couples start off their life on a cloud of excitement and happiness. But the truth is that this cloud is based more on expectations and hope for the future than actual real-life experiences that build a relationship.

When we put into perspective the reality of life, we will come to realize there is a lot of work to be done to create a rock-solid marriage.

This is serious work, and it would be better if both sides were aware of it and committed to it even before the wedding. The excitement of the engagement, wedding, and first few weeks should be taken advantage of as a strong springboard to commit yourself to each other.

That means getting your mindset ready to do sometimes difficult things for each other and putting the other's needs before your own.

The first and main place to do this is in your own mind. The commitment is not a one-time choice but needs constant review and strengthening.

Unfortunately, many times from the very beginning of the marriage this commitment is weak. People look at it as a "tryout," "let's see how it goes." These thoughts and attitudes undermine the foundation of the marriage.

Does this mean that if my marriage already started like that (even years ago), it is doomed for failure? No, but you definitely need to change your focus and mindset.

"I am here to stay."

"I am going to make this work, no matter what. I am totally committed to you and our relationship."

But these can't just be words you say one time and forget about. Just like when an entrepreneur starts a business—he 'sleeps' the business, he 'eats' the business, he 'breathes' the business—that is how I need to view my marriage.

My relationship with my spouse is the most important part of my life.

I have to live that way.

Last week, we began discussing the need to solidify your commitment in your own mind. It is crucial to view your marriage that it's forever. This is my life's partner, and I will make it my life's goal to create a rock-solid relationship, to build true oneness.

The *Gemara* teaches us that they used to ask a new *Chasan*: "*Matza or Motza*?" My Rebbe, Rav Mordechai Finkelman, explained (based on a *vort* from Rav Miller, formerly of Pittsburgh) that the word "*Matza*" means "I found," in the past tense. The *pasuk* says, "*Matza Isha, Matza Tov*"—if you found a wife, you found good. This is in the past tense. I already found her; I don't need to search anymore. I am done. Now that I know she is the one for me, I am totally committed to making the best life possible. This is because I don't second-guess it. I know it's true. That is when it will be good.

But if the answer is "*Motza*," it means that I am still finding, I am not sure. If so, the *pasuk* says, "*U'Motza Ani Mar Mi'maves, Et Ha'Isha*"—Life with a wife will be tremendously bitter. Married life is not easy. There are always ups and downs. For someone not completely dedicated to building a strong home with their spouse, it is even harder because they are starting with a weak foundation, full of doubt whether this person is really the one I should be with in the first place.

It is the doubt itself which makes life so bitter in the first place.

The difficulties that come after just strengthen the doubt. Every person who stands under the *Chuppah* with the one person whom they have decided to build their life with must implant in their hearts that this is it.

I am completely dedicated to my spouse. They are my other half; they are a part of me.

Only with this complete dedication can a couple truly begin to build their home together on a firm foundation.

Let's take a look at what might happen to a typical couple in their first few months of marriage.

Usually, the first few weeks the couple is still gliding along on the momentum of the excitement of the engagement, wedding, and *sheva brachos*. Both the new husband and wife are very motivated to be the best they can be, being extra careful to always be on their best behavior, and trying their hardest to follow the directions of their *Chasan/Kallah* teacher to the fullest.

Slowly, the new husband and wife get into their new routine, and each one begins to let their guard down. Most of the time, this starts off subconsciously, but at some point, they may consciously weaken their resolve with the excuse that, "This is my home, and I can be myself here." Some of the bad habits that they were working so hard on controlling (think: throwing your clothing on the floor, personal hygiene issues, etc.) don't seem to be so important anymore.

Each side starts to notice all these new things about the other that they have never seen before, and the magic dust that has kept the couple floating on a cloud way above the ground has suddenly disappeared, together with the cloud, and the couple now finds themselves hitting the ground hard.

This can be quite shocking for both of them, especially when it explodes in their first real fight, especially if the fight isn't even about anything important.

What do they do now?

Now is the time to gain the clear realization that to have a deep, quality marriage there is a lot of serious work that you need to put into it. The work is hard and many mistakes will be made along the way. The key to success is your complete dedication to do whatever it takes, no matter how difficult, to bring happiness and love to your home. It may be hard, but it is well worth it.

If you have been following this column very carefully, you may have noticed that I contradicted myself. I have written about commitment and putting in hard work. But I also wrote that it takes a miracle for a man and woman to live together in a happy, peaceful home.

So, which one is it? Hard work or a miracle?

The answer to this question is the key to everything. You need to understand the answer, believe the answer, internalize the answer, and then live the answer. Doing this will change your marriage and change your life.

The answer is that really there is a third partner in your home, if you let Him in. The third partner will bring with Him peace, love, and happiness. He wants to come, but you also have to want Him to come as well.

By bringing *Hashem* into your home as a full partner, you are tapping into powers that are way beyond our capabilities. *Hashem* is the one who split the sea to bring every husband and wife together. You only stood under the *chuppah* with your spouse because *Hashem* put you there, together. Now you need to bring Him into your home.

*Hashem* will bring the miracle you need, but you need to do the hard work to make Him feel welcome in your home.

The first step is to have true *emunah* and clarity in your mind and heart that it was *Hashem* who sent me my partner who will help me reach my life's mission. *Hashem* doesn't make mistakes. Trust Him.

Once you truly know that *Hashem* has sent you your soulmate, for this world and the next, you also know you can fully trust Him and bring Him into your home.

How do I do that?

We will start to discuss that next week.

There is a very deep and mystical power that a woman has to bring peace to her home through candle lighting on Friday night. Our sages have taught that *Shalom Bayis* comes through that candle light. On a very simple level, having light in the home promotes peace because it is less likely for problems to occur when there is light than when it is dark.

However, there is something much deeper in the candle light that helps create the basis of a solid, peaceful home. Light represents seeing something clearly. By "shining the light" on an issue, we are gaining clarity of that issue in order to know how to handle it in a calm, thoughtful way. A person in darkness is confused and unsure of their way. Someone with light has a clear vision of the path ahead.

The Friday night *Shabbos* lights are the lights that bring in the *Shabbos Queen*. Who is this *Shabbos Queen*? It is the *Shechinah*. *Hashem* Himself is coming into the world and into your home. When *Hashem* comes in, He brings with Him royalty and everything that comes with it. It is the source of all blessing.

It is within the candle light that a couple can see a clear vision of how to bring peace into their home. The light illuminates your understanding that it is only by having *Hashem* in your home will there be true peace. It brings the clarity that if I dedicate my home to be a place that the *Shechinah* wants to come, then I will have *Shalom Bayis* in my home.

The first step to bringing *Hashem* into your home is the complete clarity that this is, in fact, what you want more than anything else. This is my goal. This is my vision.

It is from here that everything else can be built from.

SLUG: week-8-the-guiding-light
---

Now, let's string together many of the ideas that we have discussed to show how they can practically lead to true peace in the home.

Our guiding light is the understanding that *Hashem* is the one who brought the couple together. He did this to create a home that makes up the core of the Jewish nation. *Hashem* wants us to know that this is the purpose of marriage.

The next step is to internalize that this is my purpose. It must be that *Hashem* has sent me the perfect partner to accomplish this goal. My spouse is the other half of myself, specifically filling in the parts of myself I am lacking, and vice versa. It is this complete unit which is the foundation of your home.

When we remain focused on these goals, we will realize that all the good points and difficult points of our spouse are actually intrinsically linked to creating that complete unit. It is specifically because my spouse has these traits that we have the opportunities and ability to bond into one unit.

Someone not guided by this light goes into marriage with selfish expectations: "How can I get the most out of my marriage," or in other words, "How can I take advantage of the other to get what I want." When someone is stuck in the darkness, they see their spouse's traits as bothersome and annoying, causing a rift between the couple, because clearly, it is their fault that I am not getting what I want out of this marriage.

But when my approach to marriage is to build a Jewish home, then I know two things: One, I trust in *Hashem* and I will do everything I can to bring Him into my home. And the second is that my spouse, and every detail about them, is the perfect match for me to build this home. 

It all starts by seeing life through the right light.

Now that we have established the need to make *Hashem* and His will the base of your home, we can begin to discuss how to do that. The first step, and strongest *hishtadlus* that you can do to bring peace to your home, is prayer. Our sages teach us that a person might be very bright, strong, and talented in many areas, but he will only see success if *Hashem* wants him to be successful.

So together with all the hard work necessary to build a happy home, we need to ask *Hashem* to make it successful.

I can't overemphasize how important this point is. It is very easy to go through life doing what you need to do and struggling to be successful because you don't have the help from heaven. It is sad to hear when people are willing to try every possible path to find the salvation they seek, yet they don't even consider praying for success.

I want to make this point crystal clear. Every single day, you should ask *Hashem* for His help to bring *Shalom Bayis*.

*Tefilah* is so incredibly powerful; we must tap into it and use it to our advantage. We should pray generally and specifically. We should ask *Hashem* to bring peace and love into our homes and into our hearts.

We need to make these prayers personal, asking *Hashem* to help us make deeper and stronger connections with our spouses. The prayers could and should be at any time. Do you have an important topic to bring up? Perhaps it is something very sensitive? Ask *Hashem* for help to say it the right way so it will lead to closeness and not *chas v'shalom* the opposite.

Here we have two major benefits: The first is the help from *Hashem*. *Hashem* wants you to have *Shalom Bayis*, you just need to ask Him for the help.

The second, by doing this, you are making *Hashem* a partner in your home.

When it comes to *Shalom Bayis*, every couple needs to realize that there are so many things that are not in their control. There are so many potential places for conflict that even when a *Chasan* and *Kallah* come into a marriage with the best intentions, they won't even dream of the issues they are going to have to face.

This is why you need to keep the third partner, *Hashem*, close to your heart. The automatic response to any difficulty should be to first turn to Him. There are so many issues that we won't have the answers to, but He always does. Even in the places where you think you do know the solution, it will only come to fruition if *Hashem* wills it. If you rely on Him and turn to Him, you will know everything will be good.

Sometimes you don't know what the right thing is. Sometimes you do know but need the courage to actually do it. Certainly, a couple needs a *Rav* to help guide them through life (which we will discuss at a different time).

But you need to realize that it is especially at those times that *Hashem* wants you to turn to Him. He is waiting for it. He wants that connection to you; He wants to be a part of your home. Turn to Him, make Him a part of your life.

*Tefilah* is supposed to be personal. It is called *Avodah She'balev*, service of the heart. Pray for your specific circumstances.

"*Hashem*, help me express topic X to my wife/husband the right way so it brings us together and doesn't pull us apart."

"Please *Hashem*, put the right words in my mouth to connect to my spouse."

"*Hashem*, help me every day to see the good in my spouse, and for him/her to see the good in me."

These words, and many more like them, should be your daily companion. If they are, I guarantee you will see significant changes in your home, regardless if you have been married for three months or thirty years.

The sages teach us a parable of a king who marries off his only daughter. The king is sad about being distanced from his daughter, so he asks his new son-in-law to make a room in his home so that he, the king, can always come and be close to his daughter.

This *Mashal* represents the building of the *Mishkan* in the desert. The king is *Hashem*. He gave his only daughter, the *Torah*, to the Jewish people, but he can't be separated from it. So he tells the Jewish people to build the *Mishkan* so He can be close to the *Torah*.

The added benefit is that *Hashem* also will be close to *Klal Yisrael*. The same is true for every individual home. The more *Torah* you have in your home, the more *Hashem* will be present in your home.

Learning *Torah*, and specifically learning *Torah* at home (besides for learning in the *Beis Medrash*), is the most fundamental part of building your home and bringing *Shalom Bayis* into it. It is incredibly important to say *Divrei Torah* at meals. This isn't only a nice spiritual addition to the meal, it transforms the meal into an uplifting experience. It is like eating from *Hashem's* table (*Avos* 3:4). Obviously, the content of the *Divrei Torah* should be appropriate and enjoyable for everyone.

A great way to ensure your home is one that the *Shechinah* would want to reside in is by studying *Halacha* together. There are so many topics related to the running of the home and the relationship between a husband and wife that require constant review. *Hilchos Shabbos*, *Kashrus*, *Lashon Hara*, and *Taharas Hamishpacha* are just a few examples of areas where a husband and wife could spend a few minutes a day strengthening their connection to *Hashem* and to each other.

Learning *Torah*, *Hashkafa*, or *Mussar* can greatly solidify the foundations of the home.

This is a very worthwhile idea to bring into your home. When *Hashem* sees we care, He will want to join us as well.

We have already discussed that a couple must set as its goal to have *Shalom Bayis* in every aspect of their lives together. This works hand in hand with the words of the *pasuk* [וכל נתיבותיה שלום]{dir="rtl"}, that all the ways of the *Torah* lead to peace.

This is the goal that *Hashem* set for us. Bring peace into the world and you will bring Me into the world too. Our first step is to bring peace into our own homes and that will bring the *Shechinah* into our homes.

Our prime examples of this are the *Avos* and *Imahos*, the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish people, and specifically the relationship between Avraham and Sarah. Theirs was the closest relationship of any couple in the history of the world, our sages teach. Together they came to full *Shlaimus*, completion. They were one. It was clearly seen in their tent with the candle that was miraculously lit all week, the blessing in the bread, and the cloud that hovered over their tent. It was because of their level of connection that *Hashem's* presence was clearly seen with them.

This didn't happen from nothing. The *Torah* is full of examples of the love and respect they had for each other. Each one sacrificing, being *Moser Nefesh* for the other even when it was especially difficult. Where there is love and peace *Hashem* says I want to be with them, because *Hashem's* ways are the ways of the *Torah*, and all the *Torah's* ways are peace.

*Shalom Bayis* isn't just a good piece of advice, it's the way to get to the purpose of the whole world. This is so important to *Hashem* that He is willing to erase His own name to bring peace between a husband and wife. Anyone working to strengthen their *Shalom Bayis* is working together with *Hashem*, whom the *sefarim* say will merit tremendous blessing in all areas because of it. 

Doesn't it sound worth it to put in the effort?

The *Vilna Gaon* is quoted saying that the main purpose of being born into this world is to improve one's *Middos*. This is perhaps the hardest work that anyone will do in their life. In our quest to support ourselves and raise a family, it is very easy to get lost between the little details of everyday life and forget the ultimate goal. We need to remind ourselves all the time about what our real goals are in order to be successful.

The best place to work on one's *Middos*, and the most constant, is in one's marriage. It is very common for newlyweds to come into marriage with the best intentions to be the perfect spouse. "As soon as I get married, I am quitting all those bad habits." That inspiration is a great start, but most of the time there is no real plan that is backing it up.

After a few months, when the excitement has worn off and they have settled into their new reality, all of those habits that you were sure were a thing of the past begin to seep back into your behavior, many times to the disappointment of the new spouse.

Marriage is now your reality. Your job is to create your home, your relationship. This takes work, it doesn't happen on its own. Marriage is the best medium to become the person you are supposed to be. It is specifically because you are living with the one meant to complete you that you have the opportunities to become that person. You were given each other for this purpose, through helping each other improve you come to [אחדות]{dir="rtl"}.

This isn't easy. We all have our challenges and our weak points, and no one knows them better than your spouse. But that's exactly why marriage can bring out the best in you. When you are dedicated to building your home, by bringing *Hashem* and love into your relationship, even the hardest work can be accomplished.

**Next week:** The main *Middah* you need in marriage.

As I mentioned last week, Marriage is the main medium to work on one's *middos*. Each person is given a partner, specifically designed, down to the last detail, that stands with (or opposite) them throughout the journey of life. The tests are plentiful and our job is to rise to the occasion and take the opportunities to build oneself and one's spouse.

Although every *middah* has significance, I believe the central trait one needs to truly succeed is the *Middah* of *Anavah*, humility. Being humble doesn't mean allowing the other to walk all over you. It doesn't mean you are a *shmatta*. What it means is that you understand what your relationship is, and your role in it.

When *Hashem* created man, it was clear that only together with a wife would there be a complete one unit. Without a wife a man is MISSING a part of himself.

This is what our sages teach us (*Kiddushin* 2b). That it is the way of a man to search for a wife similar to one looking for his lost object. He needs her, because she is a part of him.

It is obvious that the reverse is true as well. It is etched in the genetics of every woman to want to connect to her husband, the *Torah* tells us this point explicitly.

The relationship between a husband and wife is the connection of two parts, that when they are together create one complete unit. This is the design and desire of *Hashem*, for our couple to reach completion.

What's my role? Each spouse has to be an *anav*. You must humbly recognize that you are only half of what you should become. You need your other half, for without them, you would be severely lacking. Realize, I am not independent, and I can't be independent if I ever want to reach my potential.

The central point is to humbly accept that I am lacking, and I need my spouse to become whole.

Once we understand that each spouse is humbly reliant on the other to create one unified entity, we can learn to appreciate what each does for the other.

This message is the basis for every detail in a couple's marriage, from big to small.

One's spouse is an integral part of one's life.

Bringing *Torah* into our homes is a great example of this idea. When *Hashem* gave the [תורה]{dir="rtl"} to [בני ישראל]{dir="rtl"}, He taught us that there are two critical aspects to its acceptance.

First—that the [תורה]{dir="rtl"} would be taken as a way of life, learning [תורה]{dir="rtl"} is the greatest act that man can do.

This is our life, it's how we should spend every free moment of our lives, as we say everyday in *Tfilat Mariv*: [״ונשמח בדברי תורתך... כי הם חיינו ואורך ימינו, ובהם נהגה...״]{dir="rtl"}.

The second is the creation of an atmosphere which allows for [לימוד תורה]{dir="rtl"} to thrive.

If we look at all the details in our lives they should be enhancing and encouraging a life dedicated to *Torah* and its principles.

In order to reach our full purpose as the Jewish people we need a vessel that can hold the [תורה]{dir="rtl"} and nurture it.

When giving the *Torah*, *Hashem* turned to the women first, to ask them to accept the role of creating homes that will be that vessel that the *Torah* needs to flourish. *Hashem* knew that this was critical to ensure that their husband's *Torah* learning would reach its true potential. A man has the responsibility to bring the *Torah* into his home. A woman has the responsibility to make her home ready to accept the *Torah*.

Each side has a critical job, and each side needs the other to reach the ultimate goal.

Through working together, and becoming a complete unit, they can bring the *Torah* and the [שכינה]{dir="rtl"} into their home.

Recognize, I can't do it without you.

Last week we discussed how a couple could bring *Torah* into their home by working together. Each person's role is crucial to reaching this goal.

The practical question that many ask is, "What if I am doing my part, but my spouse isn't doing his/hers?"

This can be a very frustrating situation to be in. It is understandable when the spouse lashes out at his/her spouse for not doing their duty. "Why is he not getting out of bed?" "Why does he never go to learn?"

"Why isn't there food when I come home after a long day?" "Doesn't she realize how hard I work/learn for our family?" If each side's role is critical, what can be done when one side is struggling with theirs?

The answer lies in the realization that besides for doing your own part, you have the ability to build up your spouse as well. Anger comes when you feel helpless because you are not receiving from your spouse what you feel is their obligation to provide. Hope and confidence come when you realize that you have the tools and ability to strengthen your spouse and build them up.

*Hashem* specifically put the two of you together because you are the perfect fit to help each other reach their potential. The key is not to blame the other for their shortcomings, or to express anger or frustration. Rather, *Hashem* is showing you exactly where your job is to positively encourage and help your spouse.

Positivity is crucial. Someone who feels good about themselves is someone who will accomplish more. When you feel loved and respected for the good things you do, and for your inherent potential, it will be much easier to fulfill that potential.

This is the path that every couple should use to build each other up, for each spouse to reach their potential, and together build a [בית נאמן בישראל]{dir="rtl"}.

TITLE: Anger and Its Antidote
EXCERPT: The most destructive force in marriage causes the Shechinah to flee your home. Learn the secret from Shabbos that can transform your relationship.

The most destructive force in marriage is anger. When there is [כעס]{dir="rtl"} in the home, the [שכינה]{dir="rtl"} does not want to be in that home. We can learn this from an idea about Shabbos.

The *posuk* says: "[לא תבערו אש בכל מושבתיכם ביום השבת]{dir="rtl"}". The [זוהר הקדוש]{dir="rtl"} explains that the "fire" in the *posuk* is referring to the fire of anger. The *Torah* is warning us: It's telling us that the special *Neshama Yeseira*, the extra bit of our holy soul that is infused into us on Shabbos, is very sensitive, it is allergic to anger. If there is anger, that holy soul will leave us!

Therefore, the *Torah* warns us: "Don't light a fire of anger in your homes on Shabbos."

The same is true about the relationship between a husband and wife. *Hashem* wants to put Himself in our homes. He wants to dwell among us.

The letter "[י]{dir="rtl"}" from the word *Ish*, man, and the letter "[ה]{dir="rtl"}" from the word *Isha*, woman, represent how *Hashem* puts Himself into a relationship where a husband and wife truly love each other.

But when there is anger in the home, the *Shechinah* leaves. This creates a downward spiral, because now there is no longer a "[י]{dir="rtl"}" or "[ה]{dir="rtl"}", and the *ish* and *isha* are left only as [אש]{dir="rtl"} and [אש]{dir="rtl"}, fire and more fire, with more destruction.

It doesn't need to be this way. We need to remind ourselves who we are and what we are here to do. My spouse is a part of me, I am not whole without him/her.

Changing your perspective of your relationship will also change your perspective of the cause of the current anger. If I would have been the cause of this incident, how would I wish my spouse react to me? This is actually the truth, because your spouse is you, so your reaction should express that.

When you accustom yourself to view your spouse like that, your life will dramatically change for the better. You will bring *Hashem* back into your home.

*Shalom Bayis* doesn't just happen on its own. For two people coming from very different places, background, schooling, and experiences, to make one unified home is a great challenge.

There are two parts to rising to the challenge.

The first is to set this as your goal. When a couple makes this their goal, there will be a change of mindset. My home is not only a place where I return at night to rest and recharge so I can accomplish again tomorrow. Rather, my home is the place where I am really accomplishing my life goals.

This change of mind and heart can and should put your whole life into a different perspective. It is very unfortunate that people put their main focus and effort on accomplishing things outside their homes. This is similar to building a very tall building on a very weak foundation. So too here.

Our main focus has to be building our homes, which is the core and foundation of our lives. *Shalom Bayis*, and unity in the home, is truly the most important part of your life.

Therefore one must firmly set it as his main goal in life.

The second step is to put in the work. Just like any goal in life, without constant effort, you won't realize that goal. But the work is not good enough.

Effort without a real plan will feel very frustrating. "If I am working so hard, why am I not seeing the results I so desperately crave?"

With *Hashem's* help, in the coming weeks I will bring practical advice of how to focus our efforts to maximize the results that we are all looking for.

"Why doesn't he show appreciation for everything I do for him?" "Why doesn't she see all the effort I'm putting into our relationship, and respond?"

The first step to building towards your goal of peace in the home is to make a plan. The first point in the plan is to only focus on what you have to do, not what your spouse isn't doing. No matter what, you have to always put in 100% of yourself into the relationship, regardless of whether or not they are.

This point might seem overly difficult, especially with no positive feedback, but the truth is that this is the first step towards *Shalom*. Even if only one side puts in the effort and doesn't give up, they will eventually win over the other side too. Certainly if both sides are giving it their all.

So even if you don't see the effort of your spouse, keep going, keep working, because slowly it does make an effect.

Step two is to get into a positive mindset. You need to have absolute clarity that what you are working on is the most important thing in the world. Besides for setting the goal, which I discussed last week, it is crucial to implant and strengthen in your heart that my spouse is a part of me, that we are two halves of the same soul. Hashem created man this way, that his wife is literally a piece of him. This is true of every husband and wife.

Now your job is to make it your mantra. Here we can implement the first specific activity that is linked to the plan. It is highly recommended for every husband and wife, every single day, review this idea. Take the time to write it down and use a moment of your day, every day, to reflect on it and think about it. "My wife/husband is a part of me"...

It is tried and true, the more you do this exercise, the more this idea will be implanted deeply in your heart, and your love and desire to give to your spouse will become much stronger and more natural.

Try it.

Internalizing the essential foundation of marriage, that a husband and his wife are truly one unit, is the key to love and harmony in the home. To accomplish it we need to understand it better in our minds and we need to actively apply it. Let's discuss the two aspects.

The mitzvah of [ואהבת לרעך כמוך]{dir="rtl"} applies to every Jew. However there are different levels. The most basic level is to not do to others what you wouldn't want to be done to you. However, it is certainly praiseworthy to go beyond that stage. Showing your care for others, helping them, giving to them is certainly a hallmark of Judaism.

But this goes beyond the actual good being done. We shouldn't just do good for others because we have to, or it makes us feel good. Rather, we should truly care about them and desire their good. Getting that feeling into your heart for every Jew is not so easy. It requires identifying deeply with everyone. You need to truly feel that they are my brothers and sisters. Like you feel that way it becomes natural to want to do good for them.

The ultimate potential expression of the *mitzvah* of [ואהבת לרעך כמוך]{dir="rtl"} is with your spouse. Our sages added extra positive behaviors to the obligations of each spouse towards each other in order to do the actions that will bring out the feelings of love and unity.

The *Torah* wants a couple to be a complete unit. We must start with this idea firmly implanted in our minds, and then go through the actions that will bring this closeness with them in mind.

*Hashem* created man and woman originally as one unit to teach us that even though now they are separated, in their essence they are truly one.

That is why the potential for a natural love and connection exists between a husband and wife.

The way to tap into that love is by constantly reviewing this idea, and by doing the actions that make it a part of ourselves.

The next part of the plan is to make a goal to learn your spouse.

Many couples feel very close even before they get married. "He/She really gets me." Slowly it begins to sink in that there are so many layers to every person and there are so many things they don't know about each other. Discoveries of new aspects of your spouse can easily lead to frustration and disappointment, which can cause tension and fights.

Here is the plan: Let's keep our eyes open to the opportunities here. If one's focus is enhancing your relationship then that is how you will react to every new discovery. The approach should be "I want to know more about you. I want to know all the little details that make you, you."

This means paying attention to all aspects of your spouse, their words, mannerisms, idiosyncrasies, quirks, and of course, values. Even if you think you already understand your spouse there is always so much to learn, even when you have been married for a while.

It is specifically when you understand the small details of your spouse's personality and what is really important to them that your relationship can take a big step up.

Showing your spouse that you really "get" them—once you internalize this new knowledge—can create a tremendous closeness.

Even the discoveries that you don't like can be worked through when this is the approach.

So let's set this as our goal: "I want to really know what makes you tick, I really want to know you and appreciate your uniqueness."

This certainly takes focus, patience, and work, but it is very worthwhile.

**Next week:** Specific examples.

Let's begin with a true story. A number of years ago a couple came to me to discuss their *Shalom Bayis*. The conversation went like this:

**Husband:** "She doesn't appreciate me. I take her out to very nice restaurants. I take her on vacations. Nothing is enough for her. She doesn't acknowledge anything I do for her."

**Wife:** "He doesn't have any time for me. He is always doing something, he is never home. All I want is to sit and have a coffee with him, or take a walk together. He is too busy for me."

As it may sound, this couple was very upset with each other and they came to a point where they needed someone else to help work things out.

But really what they needed was a translator so each one could hear what the other one was saying. Really each one was saying the exact same thing, but they just didn't understand the other's language.

What were they saying?

They were both saying: "I care deeply about you and I want to express it to you, but you don't understand me, so I am very frustrated."

This is a great example of what it means to learn about your spouse. Each side has a different way of showing affection, but in order for the message to be meaningful the receiver must understand what they are receiving. You need to learn your spouse's unique language so you can give them and receive from them in a way both of you will understand and thereby appreciate. It does take time to learn it, and even longer to apply it to your life, but once you do it will upgrade your life tremendously.

Last week we gave an example of a couple who were both trying very hard to give to their spouse but were frustrated that their message was not being received. We discussed how important it is to learn your spouse, and learn their language so that you can really understand them.

This leads us to the topic of how to communicate. To really understand your spouse you need to listen to them. This seems very simple, right? Not so.

Most communication is non-verbal. Body language, tone, and context make up the majority of what it takes to understand anyone. Unfortunately in our generation, many of these components are severely lacking. Texting or "WhatsApping" is perhaps the most common form of communication between people, sadly including between a husband and wife.

There is so much lost in communication and in relationship when this happens. Very important discussions that use this mode can be very easily misunderstood and could have terrible repercussions. Even simple things can be taken the wrong way and cause unnecessary strife.

Even discussions over the phone, (which are definitely better than texting) are not ideal for important conversations. Zoom or FaceTime, or the like also cannot replace a real connection in person.

Men and women in general communicate differently, which is already a challenge. In this generation it has gotten even harder. Learning about your spouse and connecting deeply is based on really understanding what they are telling you. That means a lot more than just the actual words. This is a very important skill to acquire, the skill of listening, to really understand the message your spouse is sending you.

You will only get it if you really want to get it, and only if the communication is received using all the modes of communication.

Let's return now to another important aspect of "learning your spouse."

The home is the place where one can develop their true inner self. It is only in the home where we can fully reveal that self.

The outside world measures external success. The winners are the best, the brightest, the strongest—or so it seems.

People tend to judge one another based on external (and measurable) accomplishments. This is true in the political world, the financial world, and even in the spiritual world.

We tend to look at a person's status as a measure of his success. How many times did he finish Shas? "Is he a *Rosh Yeshiva*? A *Rosh Kollel*? Is she a *Mechanches*? A *Rebbetzin*?"

These titles do show a certain level of accomplishment, but they don't necessarily reveal the person's true essence.

Only in your home is your true self revealed. Regardless of how much recognition your spouse gets in the outside world, when you come home you are each the only husband or a wife for your spouse.

It is within the home that each spouse has the unique opportunity to help the other and bring out their best. How do we do it?

Taking true interest in your spouse. Ask them about their experiences, and listen to what they tell you. Ask about their feelings, and hear what they have to say.

The more time and patience you invest in sitting together, listening and showing interest, the more you will build trust, and the more you will learn about who your spouse really is.

And an extra side benefit: You will end up learning a lot about yourself too.

A critical part of learning about your spouse is learning about yourself, and the main purpose of marriage. The true purpose of marriage is to become whole. Every individual is inherently lacking. We were not given all the pieces we need to be complete. The Creator, in His infinite wisdom, decided to create one whole man and then to split him into two parts. This is true of all marriages.

Only when a man and woman come together in marriage will they fill in each one's missing parts in order to become whole.

Therefore, starting right now, change the way you look at your spouse by understanding yourself. I am lacking. I am missing pieces of myself. I need someone to help me to make me whole.

This shouldn't hurt your self-esteem, after all it applies to everyone. But what it does is make you take a good look at the truth. It is the recognition that "I need you to make me whole."

This realization is perhaps the strongest motivator in marriage. The more you internalize it the more you will love and respect your spouse. True respect comes from the value you give someone. The more I value them, the more you will naturally honor them and respect them.

So, take the time and think about yourself and all the things that you are missing that your spouse brings to our marriage.

It can start with the simple day to day physical things they do for me. Moving deeper, think about all the emotional aspects of my life that he or she bring to me. Of course the spiritual parts of my life the other provides. When you really take the time to do it, your appreciation and value for your spouse will translate into honor and respect for them.

But what is bigger than anything else will be your own sense of self, that together with your spouse, you will really feel whole.
