                    <p>---</p>
<p>Last week we gave an example of a couple who were both trying very hard to give to their spouse but were frustrated that their message was not being received. We discussed how important it is to learn your spouse, and learn their language so that you can really understand them.</p>
<p>This leads us to the topic of how to communicate. To really understand your spouse you need to listen to them. This seems very simple, right? Not so.</p>
<p>Most communication is non-verbal. Body language, tone, and context make up the majority of what it takes to understand anyone. Unfortunately in our generation, many of these components are severely lacking. Texting or "WhatsApping" is perhaps the most common form of communication between people, sadly including between a husband and wife.</p>
<p>There is so much lost in communication and in relationship when this happens. Very important discussions that use this mode can be very easily misunderstood and could have terrible repercussions. Even simple things can be taken the wrong way and cause unnecessary strife.</p>
<p>Even discussions over the phone, (which are definitely better than texting) are not ideal for important conversations. Zoom or FaceTime, or the like also cannot replace a real connection in person.</p>
<p>Men and women in general communicate differently, which is already a challenge. In this generation it has gotten even harder. Learning about your spouse and connecting deeply is based on really understanding what they are telling you. That means a lot more than just the actual words. This is a very important skill to acquire, the skill of listening, to really understand the message your spouse is sending you.</p>
<p>You will only get it if you really want to get it, and only if the communication is received using all the modes of communication.</p>
