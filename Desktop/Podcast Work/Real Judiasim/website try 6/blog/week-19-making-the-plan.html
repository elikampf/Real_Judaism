<p>"Why doesn't he show appreciation for everything I do for him?" "Why doesn't she see all the effort I'm putting into our relationship, and respond?"</p>
<p>The first step to building towards your goal of peace in the home is to make a plan. The first point in the plan is to only focus on what you have to do, not what your spouse isn't doing. No matter what, you have to always put in 100% of yourself into the relationship, regardless of whether or not they are.</p>
<p>This point might seem overly difficult, especially with no positive feedback, but the truth is that this is the first step towards *Shalom*. Even if only one side puts in the effort and doesn't give up, they will eventually win over the other side too. Certainly if both sides are giving it their all.</p>
<p>So even if you don't see the effort of your spouse, keep going, keep working, because slowly it does make an effect.</p>
<p>Step two is to get into a positive mindset. You need to have absolute clarity that what you are working on is the most important thing in the world. Besides for setting the goal, which I discussed last week, it is crucial to implant and strengthen in your heart that my spouse is a part of me, that we are two halves of the same soul. Hashem created man this way, that his wife is literally a piece of him. This is true of every husband and wife.</p>
<p>Now your job is to make it your mantra. Here we can implement the first specific activity that is linked to the plan. It is highly recommended for every husband and wife, every single day, review this idea. Take the time to write it down and use a moment of your day, every day, to reflect on it and think about it. "My wife/husband is a part of me"...</p>
<p>It is tried and true, the more you do this exercise, the more this idea will be implanted deeply in your heart, and your love and desire to give to your spouse will become much stronger and more natural.</p>
<p>Try it.</p>
