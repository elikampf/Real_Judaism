                    <p>---</p>
<p>The *Vilna Gaon* is quoted saying that the main purpose of being born into this world is to improve one's *Middos*. This is perhaps the hardest work that anyone will do in their life. In our quest to support ourselves and raise a family, it is very easy to get lost between the little details of everyday life and forget the ultimate goal. We need to remind ourselves all the time about what our real goals are in order to be successful.</p>
<p>The best place to work on one's *Middos*, and the most constant, is in one's marriage. It is very common for newlyweds to come into marriage with the best intentions to be the perfect spouse. "As soon as I get married, I am quitting all those bad habits." That inspiration is a great start, but most of the time there is no real plan that is backing it up.</p>
<p>After a few months, when the excitement has worn off and they have settled into their new reality, all of those habits that you were sure were a thing of the past begin to seep back into your behavior, many times to the disappointment of the new spouse.</p>
<p dir="rtl">Marriage is now your reality. Your job is to create your home, your relationship. This takes work, it doesn't happen on its own. Marriage is the best medium to become the person you are supposed to be. It is specifically because you are living with the one meant to complete you that you have the opportunities to become that person. You were given each other for this purpose, through helping each other improve you come to [אחדות]{dir="rtl"}.</p>
<p>This isn't easy. We all have our challenges and our weak points, and no one knows them better than your spouse. But that's exactly why marriage can bring out the best in you. When you are dedicated to building your home, by bringing *Hashem* and love into your relationship, even the hardest work can be accomplished.</p>
<p><em>Next week:</em> The main *Middah* you need in marriage.</p>
