Design brief for Real Judaism — visual fundamentals

Tone
- Calm, warm, modern, approachable. Prioritize legibility and a reassuring, trustworthy aesthetic.

Color palette
- Primary background / strong text: very dark charcoal (#111827) or near-black for headers and footers.
- Primary content background: off-white / warm neutral (#F7F6F2) for article surfaces.
- Accent (brand): warm gold / amber (#D9A84E) used sparingly for CTAs and highlights.
- Secondary accents: deep indigo / muted blue (#2563EB) for links and unobtrusive interactive elements.
- Soft neutrals: warm gray scale for borders and subtle UI elements (#E6E6E6, #A3A3A3).

Typography
- Headings: Poppins (medium to bold weights). Large, generous letterspacing for hero and section headings.
- Body: Inter (regular) for long-form reading — high readability, comfortable line-height (1.5) and font-size ~18px on desktop.
- Scale: H1 ~40–48px, H2 ~28–32px, H3 ~20–24px, body 16–18px; adjust responsively.

Layout & spacing
- Responsive single-column content for mobile, two-column (content + sidebar) for tablet/desktop.
- Page width max: 1100–1280px centered with 24–32px gutters on mobile and 48–72px on desktop.
- Card grid for podcast series: 2–3 columns depending on width. Cards use 16px internal padding, consistent image aspect ratio (approx 5:3 / 400×240), subtle shadow and 6–8px border-radius.
- Consistent vertical rhythm: base spacing 8px multiples (8 / 16 / 24 / 32).

Imagery
- Use high-quality series cover images (400×240 target). Prefer warm, natural photography with consistent crop and subject framing.
- Host avatar: circular crop, 160–300px depending on context.
- Hero: optional full-bleed image with dark overlay for legibility.

Cards & CTAs
- Primary CTA: filled accent (gold) with dark text or white text depending on background; prominent, rounded corners, clear affordance.
- Secondary CTA: subtle outline or muted background.
- Buttons use 12–16px padding vertically, 18–24px horizontally; clear hover and focus states.

Podcast player / embeds
- All Spotify embeds must use identical sizing and styling (uniform width, height, border-radius, consistent margin) so players look consistent across pages. Place player below episode metadata with a clear play affordance and caption.
- Default embed size: width=100% of card/content column, height ~232px. Add 6–12px rounded corners and 1px subtle border.

Blog & article pages
- Long-form articles use a comfortable measure (65–75 characters per line). Use blockquote styles, inset sidebars for notes, and prominent author / date metadata.
- Featured post card: large image, bold title, short excerpt, clear read link.

Accessibility
- Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA for normal text (contrast >= 4.5:1). Use large text variants where needed to meet AAA for headings.
- All images include `alt` text. Keyboard-focus visible styles on interactive elements. Semantic HTML structure and ARIA where necessary.

Micro-interactions
- Subtle hover transitions (150–200ms) on cards and buttons. Avoid excessive animation; prefer functional, unobtrusive motion.

Ads & book promo
- Non-intrusive, dismissible promo panel: top or bottom-right small modal/card with clear close `X`. Store dismissal in localStorage so it does not reappear for users who close it. Keep promo styling consistent with site (use neutrals + brand accent).

Content tone & copy
- Clean, plain language that reads smoothly. Avoid loaded labels the owner dislikes (do not use words such as the ones the owner flagged). Prefer warm, direct phrasing.

Developer notes
- Use vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks). Keep JS minimal and cross-browser compatible.
- Design assets: consistent iconography and spacing tokens.
- Ordering rules for series listing UI: ensure series ordering rules are applied consistently (some series listed oldest-first, others newest-first per editorial rules).
