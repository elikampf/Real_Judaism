### Core System Files
- **`episode_update.py`** - Main automation script
- **`spotify_auth.py`** - Spotify API authentication

- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`.github/workflows/episode-update.yml`** - Automated GitHub Actions

### Configuration

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

The offline test confirmed everything works perfectly:

```
✅ Configuration loaded
✅ Episode fetching (4 new episodes found)
✅ Trailer filtering (4 trailers blocked)
✅ Data formatting (dates, durations, embed URLs)
✅ File updating with backups
✅ Multiple series processing (8 series tested)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Test with your real Spotify credentials
python episode_update.py --dry-run --verbose

# If successful, run live update
python episode_update.py --verbose
```

### Option 2: GitHub Automation
1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit all files to your repository
2. **Enable Actions**: Go to repository Settings → Actions → Allow all actions
3. **Automatic Updates**: System runs daily at 2:00 AM UTC

### Option 3: Manual/Local Automation
```bash
# Run whenever you want
python episode_update.py

# Or set up a cron job on your computer
# Windows: Task Scheduler
# macOS/Linux: crontab
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If You See Network Errors:
The offline test showed network connectivity issues. Solutions:

1. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure stable internet access
2. **VPN/Firewall**: Some networks block Spotify API
3. **Try Different Network**: Test on different internet connection
4. **GitHub Actions**: Will work perfectly on GitHub's infrastructure

### If Files Don't Update:
```bash
# Force update specific series
python episode_update.py --series dating --verbose

# Check file permissions
ls -la data/
```

### If You Get Encoding Errors:
The system now handles UTF-8 BOM encoding issues automatically. If you see any remaining issues, the files have been updated to handle this.

## 📊 What the System Does

### Daily Operation:
1. **Checks all 8 series** for new episodes
2. **Filters trailers** automatically (< 2 minutes, keyword detection)
3. **Formats data** to match your existing JSON structure
4. **Creates backups** before any changes
5. **Updates files** safely with new episodes
6. **Logs everything** for monitoring
