  - Scale transforms on hover
  - Gradient overlay effects
- **Top Accent Bar**: Animated gradient bar appears on hover

### 4. ✅ Smooth Animations & Micro-Interactions

## Technical Details

### Performance Considerations
- All animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- Cubic-bezier timing functions for natural motion
- Reduced motion media queries for accessibility
- Will-change hints on interactive elements

### Browser Compatibility
- Webkit prefixes for gradient text effects
- Fallback colors for older browsers
- Backdrop-filter with fallbacks
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Accessibility Features
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- High contrast maintained throughout
- Focus states clearly visible
- Semantic HTML structure preserved

## Visual Impact

### Before
- Flat, basic design
- Limited color palette
- Simple hover effects
- Static, minimal animations

### After
- Multi-dimensional depth
- Rich, vibrant color scheme
- Sophisticated micro-interactions
- Dynamic, engaging animations
- Professional, world-class aesthetic

## File Size
- **Total CSS**: 152,240 bytes (formatted)
- **Includes**: All enhancements + original styles
- **Well-organized**: Formatted and commented

## Next Steps (Optional)
If further enhancements are desired:
1. Add parallax scrolling effects
2. Implement dark mode theme
3. Add more page transitions
4. Create custom loading animations
