# Real Judaism Website - Cursor Development Rules

## PROJECT CONTEXT
You are building a Torah education platform website called "Real Judaism" that combines Torah wisdom with psychological insight. The site serves Orthodox Jewish men ages 18-35 with podcast series, blog content, and both English and Hebrew (RTL) sections.

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

### Never Replace Code with Placeholders
- NEVER write comments like `// ... rest of processing ...` or `// ... existing code ...`
- ALWAYS write complete, functional code for every request
- If modifying existing code, show the COMPLETE updated version
- Break large tasks into smaller, complete steps rather than using placeholders

### File Organization Standards
```
/
├── index.html (Homepage)
├── podcast/ (Main podcast page + individual series)
├── blog/ (Blog section)
├── about/ (About page)
├── hebrew-home/ (Hebrew hub + series)
├── contact/ (Contact forms)
├── images/ (All image assets)
├── episodes/ (CSV data)
├── css/ (Stylesheets)
├── js/ (JavaScript files)
├── data/ (JSON files for episodes)
└── legal/ (Privacy, Terms)
```

### Component Standards
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow BEM CSS methodology for class naming
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Accessibility: proper ARIA labels, semantic markup, keyboard navigation
- Performance: lazy loading, optimized images, minified assets

### Color Palette (Strict Usage)
```css
:root {
  --charcoal: #2d3748;    /* Main text, headers, navigation */
  --pure-white: #ffffff;   /* Backgrounds */
  --amber: #ed8936;       /* CTAs, accents, hover states */
  --amber-hover: #d97706; /* Hover state */
  --amber-active: #c05621; /* Active state */
  --light-gray: #f7fafc;  /* Subtle sections */
  --gray: #718096;        /* Secondary text */
  --border-gray: #e2e8f0; /* Form borders */
}
```

### Typography Standards
- Font Family: Inter (import from Google Fonts)
- Base font size: 16px
- Line height: 1.6 for body text
- Headings: Use proper hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Font weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold)

### Button Component Standards
```css
/* Primary Button */
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--amber);
  color: var(--pure-white);
  font: Inter, 16px, medium;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: none;
  transition: background 0.3s ease;
}

.btn-primary:hover { background: var(--amber-hover); }
.btn-primary:active { background: var(--amber-active); }
```

### RTL (Hebrew) Implementation Rules
- Use `dir="rtl"` attribute on Hebrew pages
- Use `lang="he"` for Hebrew content
- Mirror layouts: flexbox `flex-direction: row-reverse`
- Text alignment: `text-align: right` for Hebrew content
- Navigation flows right-to-left on Hebrew pages
- Form labels appear to the right of inputs

### Responsive Breakpoints
```css
/* Mobile */
@media (max-width: 767px) { }
/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) { }
/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1024px) { }
```

### Form Implementation (Netlify Forms)
- Use `data-netlify="true"` attribute
- Include honeypot field for spam protection: `<input name="bot-field" type="hidden" />`
- Proper form validation (HTML5 + JavaScript)
- Success/error state styling
- Redirect to thank you pages after submission

### Spotify Integration Standards
- Use responsive iframe containers for Spotify embeds
- Include fallback links when embeds fail
- Implement loading states for embed players
- Format: `https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/EPISODE_ID`

### Performance Requirements
- Images: Use WebP format with fallbacks
- Implement lazy loading for episode lists
- Minify CSS/JS for production
- Proper caching headers via Netlify
- Page load time target: Under 3 seconds

### Episode Data Structure
Episodes are stored in CSV format and should be converted to JSON for dynamic loading:
```json
{
  "series": {
    "seriesName": {
      "name": "Display Name",
      "order": "chronological" | "reverse-chronological",
      "episodes": [
        {
          "title": "Episode Title",
          "description": "Episode Description",
          "spotifyEmbed": "Full Spotify Embed URL",
          "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
          "length": "MM:SS"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Card Grid Standards
- Homepage: 3×2 grid (desktop), 2×3 (tablet), 1×6 (mobile)
- Card hover effects: `translateY(-2px)` with enhanced shadow
- Border radius: 12px
- Shadow: `0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`
- Container max-width: 1200px
- Gap: 32px between cards

### Navigation Standards
- Main nav height: 80px
- Sticky navigation behavior
- Left: "Unfiltered Wisdom for Jewish Life" tagline
- Right: Navigation items with dropdowns
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with slide-out drawer

### SEO Implementation
- Include proper meta tags for each page
- Implement structured data for podcast episodes
- Create sitemap.xml automatically
- Optimize images with alt text
- Use semantic HTML structure

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Foundation & Layout
1. Set up project structure and basic HTML templates
2. Implement CSS reset and base styles
3. Create responsive navigation with dropdown
4. Build homepage hero and card grid

### Phase 2: Content Pages
1. Individual podcast series pages with Spotify embeds
2. About page with two-column layout
3. Blog page with post grid
4. Contact forms with Netlify integration

### Phase 3: Hebrew Section
1. Hebrew homepage with RTL layout
2. Hebrew podcast series pages
3. RTL-specific styling adjustments
4. Hebrew navigation integration

### Phase 4: Dynamic Content
1. Convert CSV episode data to JSON
2. Implement dynamic episode loading
3. Add search/filter functionality if needed
4. Performance optimization

### Error Handling Standards
- Create custom 404 page
- Implement form error states
- Add loading states for dynamic content
- Handle failed Spotify embeds gracefully

### Testing Requirements
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness verification
- RTL layout testing
- Form functionality testing
- Accessibility audit with screen readers

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
- Don't use external CSS frameworks (write custom CSS)
- Don't ignore RTL layout requirements for Hebrew content
- Don't forget form honeypot fields for spam protection
- Don't use placeholder content in production code
- Don't skip image optimization and lazy loading
- Don't forget proper semantic HTML structure
- Don't ignore accessibility requirements
- Don't hardcode episode data (use dynamic loading)

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS
Before completing any major section:
1. Validate HTML markup
2. Test responsive design on all breakpoints
3. Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation
4. Test form submissions and error handling
5. Confirm RTL layout works properly for Hebrew content
6. Optimize images and check loading performance
7. Test cross-browser compatibility

Remember: This is a Torah education platform serving a specific audience. The code should be clean, performant, and respectful of both the content and the users' needs.
